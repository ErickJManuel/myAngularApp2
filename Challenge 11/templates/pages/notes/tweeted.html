  On the notes tweeted page, within the tweeted.html template, use filter to display only notes that have been tweeted
  (i.e., having a tweeted property set to true).

        1.  On the notes tweeted page, within the tweeted.html template, use filter to display only notes that have been tweeted (i.e., having a tweeted property set to true).
        2.  The notes tweeted page has a search field so that users can filter notes. Let's take advantage of this using another filter.
            Add an additional search filter to the displayed notes on our notes tweeted page.
        3.  Use a filter to display the tweeted date in our p tag like so: Tweeted on a Monday in October.
            In the p tag inside the .card div, create a date filter on note.tweetedDate and then provide the format that will give us the Tweeted on a Monday in October format.
        4.  It's the middle of the night and you are ready to finish your Angular NoteWrangler app! You realize the title of our card container div would be more beneficial if
            it included a fancy date along with the title of the note.
            Add the date to the end of the title and format it like so: Oct. 08.
      //-->
      <a class="card-notes" ng-repeat="note in notes | filter: {tweeted:true} | filter: searchTerm" ng-href="#/notes/{{note.id}}">
        <div class="card" title="{{note.title} {{note.tweetedDate | date: 'MMM dd'}}">
          <h2 class="h3">{{note.title}}</h2>
          <p>{{note.tweetedDate | date: "'Tweeted on a' EEEE 'in' MMMM"}}</p>
